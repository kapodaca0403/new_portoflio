          Greetings! My name is K'trina Apodaca yes, like the hurricane. A
          little bit about me, I have lived in the Denver area my entire life. I
          love the idea of having more than one season even if it isn't for
          long. After graduating highschool I was one of those individuals whom
          was a little indecisive when it came to choosing a career path. I
          thought it would be best to start out at a Community College to gain
          my general credits and to take a few classes may have caught my eye.
        </p>

          I previously worked for a Customer Serivce Company handling anything
          fraud related. I gained an understanding of ways to locate account
          takeovers in the user activity log. I also got acquainted with
          learning about system bugs, locating solutions and giving feedback to
          our internal offices However, the company decided to start a new
          adventure overseas.

          BUT it has been the perfect opportunity for me to start my new
          adventure as well. I noticed when I would search for new job
          opportunities different softwares were required. Then, one day on
          LinkedIn a post from Denver University was a little bit of information
          about a coding bootcamp. After, a little reasearch I decided to take a
          leap of faith and enroll in the bootcamp to start my new adventure. I
          have now opened my world to coding and I don't think I will go back.
          It has changed my entire perspective on how applications and webpages
          work and I cannot wait to discover more.
